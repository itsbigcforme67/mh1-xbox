# Agent C notes: monster (em) action files in game.bin

Reference for decompiling monster code. Everything here was checked with
tools/check.py and `tools/rebuild.sh game` (game OK) unless marked as a guess.

## Monster file structure (seen in f_em07/08/...)

Each small emNN file holds the action setters for one monster kind:
- emNN_act_act_set / move_act_set / fly_act_set / atk_act_set(EMW *em, u16 no, u16 arg):
  set em->act_spd (0x930) = 1.0f, sometimes tweak `no` or the per-monster
  work, then call em_act_set2(em, group, no, arg) with group 0/1/2/3.
- emNN_act_set(EMW *em, int kind, u16 no, u16 arg): runs
  em_cdm_act_flag_ck(em) when em->x8C3 == 0, then `switch ((u16)kind)`
  dispatches to the four setters above; kinds 4-6 call em_act_set2 directly.
- Some files add fly_adjy2_init / fly_adjy2_subx / suby / subz (file
  statics, renamed with their address by the split) / emNN_fly_adjy2, and
  senkai_* (turning) helpers.

Prototypes that matched:
- `void em_act_set2(EMW *, int group, u16 no, u16 arg);` (u16 so callers
  pass u16 params on without re-masking; with int params they get masked).
- `void em_cdm_act_flag_ck(EMW *);`
- `f32 CalcDistanceXZ(f32 *, f32 *); u16 Em_Calc_angY(f32 *, f32 *);`

## EMW fields added (include/em.h)

- 0x444 `ex[]`: per-monster work area. Its layout differs per monster
  (em07 keeps a distance float at +0x10 and a flag at +0x16; em08 uses +0xD
  and +0x34). Each emNN.c defines its own `EMNNW` struct and casts
  `(EMNNW *)em->ex`. The end of the area (0x50C) is a guess.
- 0x881 x881: non-zero when there is a target (value 7 seen in em08).
- 0x8C3 x8C3, 0x930 act_spd (guess at meaning), 0x934 tgt_pos[3].

## Matching lessons

- em07_move_act_set: the angle window test
  `(0 <= a && a <= 0x4000) || (a >= 0xC000 && a <= 0xFFFF)` on a u16 `a`
  must be written `0 <= a`; `a >= 0` gives bltz, `a > -1` is 2 off.
  The original has slt at, a, zero.
- em07_act_set: `kind` is an int param switched as `(u16)kind`; with a u16
  param MWCC reuses the masked value for the em_act_set2 call.

## Files

- em07 (0x599ED0-0x59A23C, 5 functions): all match. src/game/em/em07.c,
  jump table slot 0x686860-0x68687C.
